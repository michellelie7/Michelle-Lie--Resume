        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">AccountingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Michelle Lie has decided to pursue a major in business. She would like a degree in accounting after being inspired by her father. She was inspired to become a certified public account just like him after he brought her to work where she was able to see first hand how a CPA works. She liked the environment he was working in and thought it was fascinating to see how he was able to communicate with many clients and be able to complete all his work in a timely fashion. She took an accounting class in high school and found joy in writing up financial statements and seeing how all the numbers fall into place. 

Michelle comes from Los Angeles and is currently a first-year and she is attending the University of California, Riverside. She is a pre-business student and she hopes to choose a concentration in accounting or information systems. She hopes to get her Bachelorâ€™s degree in one of those fields. 

Despite not having a lot of work experience in the business world, she has prior experience in multiple organizations in high school that brought her where she is today. She joined the Leo Service Club, American Cancer Awareness, Biomed, Kidshare, TAB, and the Level Up Gaming Club. Leo stands for leadership, experience, and opportunity. With Leo, she was able to develop leadership skills while participating in organizations such as the Los Angeles Food Bank and Home of Angels. At the Los Angeles food bank, she helped create food packs for those in need. She would sort through all the food and ensure that nothing was rotting or expired. At the Home of Angels, she helped those with special needs to be able to adapt to everyday life. American Cancer Awareness is a club where they support the fight against cancer and also spreading awareness to others. They do this by holding annual events at school. Biomed is a class that involves research. Students would be conducting research on their own, and by junior year, they must obtain a mentor and work under their guidance. Kidshare is a club where they would host annual book and toy drives for children. These books and toys would be given to children in need. TAB which is also known as Teen Advisory Board is a program that has regular meetings at the library. Their goal was to promote reading and to host interactive activities. The last organization Michelle was involved in was the level up gaming club. Michelle did not spend all her time gaming as she held a very important position. She was the treasurer of the club. As treasurer, she was in charge of the clubâ€™s funds and had to make sure that the money does not go missing or any calculations go wrong. Michelle has also worked with a private company that sold tropical fish. She has helped them by creating descriptions or the different types of fish that they owned and helped with marketing on their website. Her job was to create descriptions, promote the fish, and appeal to the buyers so they would buy the fish.

She has many skills that will deem very useful in her future career. She is responsible as she never fails to complete her assignments early and is not afraid to ask for help as she regularly visits office hours to deepen her understanding. She is organized and does not miss a deadline for any assignments. She makes sure to have all her important documents with her when going to ask or when asking a question. She is hardworking and will accept any obstacles that come her way. She tries her best to overcome it. She is also able to communicate with her peers well as she tries to ensure that everyone in her group is following along and that no one is left behind.
